    This workshop was quite interesting. I made my own string functions like strCpy, strnCpy etc... which are i am using by string library before this workshop.
    I made several functions for strings and learn how they works by this workshop. In my first semester C course (btp100) i was using string library for strings.
    From this workshop I made that function on my own and I didn't use any string library provided by C++. 

    In first part of workshop I learned about modules and how to link them together to make application easily. I learned how to include header module into the
    main cpp module and how to safeguards header modules. safeguards protects from multiple inclusions. First part (LAB) was very easy i just had to make different modules
    and compiles them to execute a program. I didn't face any issue or difficulty in part-1 of this workshop.

    In second part of workshop I learned about structure of string function and implementation of them. Second part was very interesting and I had some little issue in
    strStr function. I was getting warning during run time as nullptr is not defined, then i include iostream header file and it worked. Everything else is easy to 
    implement and i had not face any issues as i am familiar with string functions from btp100 course.
